/**
 * Does the grader actually grade?
 *
 * `npm run eval` reports every conversation clean. That means nothing on its own — a rubric whose
 * checks never fire reports exactly the same thing. So this suite runs a DELIBERATELY BAD AGENT
 * through the same harness and asserts that each hard check catches its own failure.
 *
 * 🔴 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE IN THE TEST DIRECTORY, and it is worth saying why. Every
 * other test asserts that good behaviour passes. Only this one asserts that bad behaviour fails,
 * and "everything passed" and "nothing was checked" are the same observation from outside.
