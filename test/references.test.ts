/**
 * Every file this repository points at must exist.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A HABIT. The documentation here is unusually dense in pointers —
 * "see `src/carrier/vad.ts`", "read `docs/LIMITS.md` §9" — because that is how a page stays short
 * and still tells the truth. The cost of that style is a class of failure nothing else catches: a
 * file gets renamed, or a page promises a document somebody meant to write, and the pointer rots.
 * Nothing goes red. The person who finds it is the new one, on their first morning, deciding this
 * repository cannot be trusted.
 *
 * Two real instances on 2026-09-12: `src/seam/client.ts` sent readers to `src/tuning/defaults.ts`,
 * which has never existed under that name, and a docs page referenced a deploy checklist that was
 * still an intention. Both were written by somebody who knew what they meant.
 *
 * 🔴 WITH A POSITIVE CONTROL, because a scanner that finds no bad references and a scanner whose
 * pattern stopped matching are the same observation from outside.
