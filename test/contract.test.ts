/**
 * Does this repository still agree with itself about what the backend looks like?
 *
 * There are three copies of the Seam 4 shapes in here — `contract/seam4.json` (the snapshot),
 * `src/seam/types.ts` (what the code compiles against) and `src/mock/fixtures/scenarios.json`
 * (what the tests run against). Three copies drift. This suite makes them drift LOUDLY.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT CANNOT DO, stated plainly so nobody reads a green run as more than it is: it cannot
 * see platform-backend. If the backend renames a field tomorrow, all three copies here will still
 * agree with each other and this suite will still pass. Catching THAT is `npm run contract:derive`,
 * pointed at a checkout of the backend, and it is a thing a person runs — not a thing CI knows.
