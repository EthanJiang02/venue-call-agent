/**
 * The seam client, against the local mock. No database, no network, no credential, no phone.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR. Twelve refusals exist on the other side of a cloud boundary and every
 * one of them ends a call. Before this file they were readable and not runnable, which is the
 * state in which a refusal path quietly stops working and nobody finds out until a restaurant is
 * on the line. Each is now exercised by name.
 *
 * 🔴 IT INCLUDES A SABOTAGE CONTROL, at the bottom. A suite that passes because it asserts nothing
 * and a suite that passes because the code is right look identical from outside, so the last block
 * proves the assertions can fail.
