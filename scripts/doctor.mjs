/**
 * `npm run doctor` — what this laptop can and cannot do right now, and exactly why.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. "Which credentials do I need?" was answered three different ways in this
 * repository inside two days, and every one of them was a sentence in a document. A sentence in a
 * document is a claim about the environment; this is a reading of it. When the two disagree,
 * believe this one and fix the document.
 *
 * 🔴 A MISSING CREDENTIAL IS NOT A FAILURE HERE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
 * `src/config.ts` was rewritten once for exactly this reason: a boot check that demanded all four
 * values blocked a laptop that needed none of them, and protected nothing, because a service that
 * cannot start never reaches a call either. So this script exits 0 on a completely empty
 * environment. It exits non-zero only when the LOCAL path — the one that needs nothing — is
 * actually broken. Anything else is reported and costed, not enforced.
 *
 * 🔴 IT CHECKS BEHAVIOUR, NOT CONFIGURATION, WHEREVER IT CAN.
 * "Node 22.18 is installed" is a hypothesis about type-stripping. So this imports a real `.ts`
 * file and calls a function in it. "The mock exists" is a hypothesis about the test environment.
 * So this boots the mock on an ephemeral port, asks it for a call context, and shuts it down. A
 * check that reads a version string and stops is the kind that reports green on a laptop where
 * nothing runs.
 *
 * 🔴 IT SHIPS WITH A POSITIVE CONTROL AND RUNS IT EVERY TIME.
 * Same argument as `scripts/check-no-facts.mjs`: a probe that reports "all good" is
 * indistinguishable from a probe whose detection is broken. Before printing anything, this hands
 * EVERY REAL CHECK a subject it must reject — an unsupported Node version, a module that is not
 * there, a directory with no lockfile — and fails if any of them reports health. A doctor that
 * cannot see illness is worse than no doctor, because somebody will believe it.
 *
 * 🔴 THE CONTROL MUST SHARE CODE WITH THE CHECKS OR IT IS THEATRE. The first version called a
 * function whose whole body was `return { state: 'broken' }`. Stubbing every real check to
 * return `ok` left it printing "Detection works." That is why each check now takes its subject
 * as an argument: blinding a check blinds its control with it.
 *
 * Runs with NO dependencies installed. It is the first thing to run on a fresh clone, before
 * `npm ci`, and it must work there or it is useless at the only moment it is needed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/doctor.mjs            human-readable
 *   node scripts/doctor.mjs --json     the same reading as JSON, for a script or a CI step
 *   node scripts/doctor.mjs --control  run ONLY the control, and fail if it does not trip
