/**
 * The Seam 4 contract, in TypeScript.
 *
 * These types mirror `platform-backend`'s `venueCall.service.ts` at the commit recorded in
 * `contract/seam4.json`. They are a COPY of somebody else's shapes, which means they can go stale
 * silently — the other repository deploys on its own cadence and nothing here can see it. That is
 * what `contract/seam4.json` and `test/contract.test.ts` are for: the shapes are written down once
 * in a machine-readable form, and a test fails if this file and that file stop agreeing.
 *
 * 🔴 THE ONE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THIS FEATURE SAFE lives in these types and is easy to miss:
 * every field the restaurant will HEAR is a `string` that arrived from the backend, finished.
 * There is no field here holding a number, a price or a name that this service is expected to put
 * into a sentence itself. If you ever find yourself adding one, the fix is an endpoint over there,
 * not a template over here.
