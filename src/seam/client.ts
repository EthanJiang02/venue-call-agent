/**
 * The only way this service talks to CreatoRain.
 *
 * Three calls, one credential, and every failure shaped so the caller cannot accidentally carry on
 * talking. There is no `getOrDefault` here and there never will be: a default returned to a voice
 * agent is a sentence spoken to a restaurant.
 *
 * 🔴 A REFUSAL IS NOT AN ERROR TO RECOVER FROM. Every 409 means the call cannot proceed, and the
 * correct handling of all twelve is the same — stop before speaking. They are separate words only
 * so the operator reading the ledger afterwards can tell "nobody configured this" from "somebody
 * presented a bad credential".
 *
 * 🔴 A TIMEOUT IS NOT A REFUSAL. If the seam does not answer, we do not know whether the booking
 * still stands, and "I don't know" is not a thing to say to somebody holding a table. The caller
 * must end the call, not improvise around it. `SeamUnavailable` is deliberately a different class
 * from `SeamRefusal` so a `catch` cannot flatten the two.
