/**
 * THE RUBRIC. What "the agent behaved" means, written down as checks that run.
 *
 * Six of these are HARD and the rest are SOFT, and the split is not about how much each one
 * matters in the abstract — it is about whether a failure is a defect or a judgement call. A hard
 * check failing means the call did something it must never do; there is no threshold to tune and
 * no reviewer to consult. A soft check failing means the call was worse than we want, which is a
 * conversation.
 *
 * 🔴 A SCORE IS NOT A GATE. `npm run eval` prints both, and CI fails on hard checks only. A
 * percentage that drifts from 94 to 91 is information; a disclosure that did not get spoken is a
 * stop. Collapsing those into one number is how the second one gets averaged away by the first.
