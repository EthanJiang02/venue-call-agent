/**
 * THE SEAM BETWEEN THE HARNESS AND THE BRAIN.
 *
 * Everything on this side of the interface is built: a mock backend, a replay harness, an eval
 * rubric, a fabrication check, and a reference implementation that proves all of it runs. The
 * brain — the thing that actually holds a Gemini Live session open and turns audio into turns —
 * is the Gemini Live adapter task and is deliberately not here.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THE INTERFACE HAS NO AUDIO IN IT. A turn is text in, text and tool calls out. That is not
 * a simplification for testing; it is the only shape in which the important properties are
 * checkable at all. "Did it speak before the disclosure", "did it quote the sentence the backend
 * returned", "did it log the question before promising a follow-up" are claims about a transcript.
 * Audio is a transport underneath this, and a real implementation carries one — but nothing that
 * can go wrong in front of a restaurant is decided in the audio layer.
 *
 * So: implement `CallAgent` with a model behind it, and every test, fixture and score in this
 * repository applies to it unchanged.
