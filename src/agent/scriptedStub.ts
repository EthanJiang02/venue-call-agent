/**
 * A REFERENCE AGENT WITH NO MODEL IN IT.
 *
 * 🔴 THIS IS NOT THE DELIVERABLE. The Gemini Live adapter replaces it with something that holds a Gemini Live
 * session open and hears actual audio. This one matches keywords, and it would be embarrassing on
 * a real telephone.
 *
 * IT EXISTS FOR THREE REASONS, and they are worth stating because "delete the stub" is otherwise
 * the obvious first move:
 *
 *   1. It makes the harness, the rubric and the fabrication check RUNNABLE TODAY. A test
 *      infrastructure with nothing to run is a test infrastructure nobody has proved.
 *   2. It is an EXECUTABLE SPECIFICATION. Everything the real agent must do — disclosure first,
 *      never deliver the notice to a machine, log before deferring, obey a stop request inside the
 *      same turn — is here in the smallest form that satisfies the rubric. When the real one
 *      fails a check, this file is the answer to "what was it supposed to do".
 *   3. It is the BASELINE. The real agent must score at least what this scores, and if it does
 *      not, a keyword matcher is beating a language model and that is worth knowing before a
 *      restaurant hears it.
 *
 * Keep it passing. When the real agent lands, run both: `npm run eval` takes `--agent=stub` or
 * `--agent=live`, and the day the live one wins on every fixture is the day this stops mattering.
 *
 * NO-FACTS-EXEMPT[comp]: the topic cues must hold the words a manager uses to ask about money.
 * They RECOGNISE a question and are never spoken - every sentence this file says comes from the seam.
