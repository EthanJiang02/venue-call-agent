/**
 * The call state machine.
 *
 * 🔴 THE LOAD-BEARING PROPERTY: no outbound audio may leave before the disclosure has been spoken.
 * There is deliberately NO transition from `connected` to anything except `disclosing`. A
 * restaurant has to be told what this call is before it hears anything else, and the machine — not
 * a reviewer's diligence — is what makes that true.
 *
 * The Gemini Live adapter fills in the behaviour. This file exists so the shape, and the one rule that must not be
 * negotiated away, are in place before anyone writes the interesting part.
