/**
 * THE TWO AUDIO WORLDS THIS SERVICE SITS BETWEEN, and the fact that neither is negotiable.
 *
 * A telephone line and a language model do not speak the same audio, and the conversion is ours.
 * Getting it wrong does not throw — it produces a call that sounds like a robot underwater, or
 * silence that is actually full-scale noise, and neither shows up in a unit test that never looks
 * at a sample.
 *
 * 🔴 A CORRECTION TO AN EARLIER NOTE. It said the Live API
 * "resamples INPUT itself (send 8 kHz, declare audio/pcm;rate=8000), only the 24 kHz→8 kHz
 * outbound leg is ours." The first half is true and the conclusion does not follow. The API
 * accepts raw little-endian 16-bit PCM at a declared rate — it does NOT accept μ-law. A telephone
 * hands us μ-law, so the inbound leg needs a G.711 decode before anything is declared, and that
 * decode is unavoidably ours. Both legs are ours; only the resampling half of the inbound one is
 * theirs.
 *   source: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-guide — "Audio data in the Live API is
 *   always raw, little-endian, 16-bit PCM. Audio output always uses a sample rate of 24kHz."
 *   re-fetched 2026-09-12.

/**
 * 🔴 WHAT THE CARRIER SPEAKS — AN ASSUMPTION, NOT A DECISION, and the difference matters.
 *
 * No carrier is connected. Twilio has been suspended since 2026-07-22, no dialler exists in the
 * backend, and a grep across every venue-call file for `mulaw|g711|8000|pcmu|opus|codec|sample
 * rate` returns nothing — the only transport statement anywhere in the codebase is a note in
 * `venueCallToken.ts` that the token travels as a TwiML `<Parameter>` inside `<Connect><Stream>`.
 *
 * These values are the G.711 μ-law/8 kHz/20 ms that every North American carrier media stream
 * uses, including the one that note implies. They are the right thing to build against and they
 * are still a guess until the carrier work picks a carrier.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO CALL SITE MAY HARDCODE 8000. Read it from here, so that when the guess is settled there
 * is exactly one line to change and a failing test to tell you that you missed one.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * UPDATE 2026-09-12 — the guess is now a MEASURED RANGE, and `bytesPerFrame` cannot survive a
 * second carrier as a constant. Read from each vendor's own documentation:
 *
 *   Twilio   μ-law 8 kHz mono, and ONLY that. 20 ms = 160 bytes.
 *   Telnyx   PCMU 8 kHz by default; also PCMA, G722, OPUS, AMR-WB and L16/16k. 20 ms of
 *            L16/16k = 640 bytes. Telnyx recommends L16 for AI voice agents.
 *   Plivo    μ-law 8 kHz, ~20 ms documented. 160 bytes.
 *   Vonage   L16 only, 8/16/24 kHz, raw binary. 20 ms = 320 / 640 / 960 bytes.
 *
 * Three consequences worth writing down before anyone picks:
 *
 *   1. `bytesPerFrame` is a function of (encoding, sampleRate), not a constant. `AudioFormat`
 *      above already has both fields; the constant is the shortcut, and it is on borrowed time.
 *   2. On Telnyx L16/16 kHz the G.711 codec leaves the call path entirely and the model gets
 *      16 kHz instead of 8. That is an argument about carriers, not an argument for deleting
 *      `src/audio/mulaw.ts` — on Twilio it is mandatory and on the hot path.
 *   3. 🔴 NO CARRIER TAKES 24 kHz. Twilio caps at 8, Telnyx and Plivo at 16, and Vonage's own
 *      two pages disagree with each other about whether 24 exists. Gemini Live always returns
 *      24 kHz. So the 24k → 8k decimation in `src/audio/resample.ts` is permanent infrastructure
 *      rather than a stopgap, whichever carrier wins.
