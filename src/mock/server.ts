/**
 * A LOCAL STAND-IN FOR SEAM 4. It has no database, no credentials and no network egress.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Everything about this feature that can go wrong in front of a restaurant is
 * decided by what comes back from three HTTP routes: whether the call proceeds at all, which
 * sentence is spoken, whether a deferral is allowed. Without a stand-in, exercising any of that
 * means a running platform-backend, a database with the right rows in it, and a signing secret —
 * which in practice means it does not get exercised, and the twelve refusal paths are read rather
 * than run.
 *
 * So: the shapes from `contract/seam4.json`, served from `fixtures/scenarios.json`, on localhost.
 * Every one of the twelve refusals is reachable by name (test/contract.test.ts holds that to
 * account). Nothing here talks to anything.
 *
 * 🔴 THE MOCK IS ALLOWED TO AUTHOR SENTENCES AND THE AGENT IS NOT. That asymmetry is the point of
 * the whole design, so it is worth being blunt about: this file is imitating the component that
 * owns the words. If you find yourself moving a sentence OUT of here and into `src/` proper to
 * make something easier, you have just deleted the property the feature is built on.
 *
 * 🔴 IT IMITATES THE BACKEND AS SHIPPED, read at the commit in `contract/seam4.json`. That
 * includes the campaign rule, which is easy to guess wrong: a PAUSED campaign's booking is still
 * called (`campaign-paused` proceeds), and a closed, cancelled, draft or unknown one refuses
 * (`campaign-closed`). Pausing stops new outreach, not a visit that is already booked. The rule
 * is `campaign_rule` in the snapshot, and `npm run contract:derive` checks it against the backend.
 *
 * HOW A CALLER PICKS A SCENARIO. The bearer token doubles as the selector: `mock:<scenario>`, or
 * `mock:<scenario>:<reservation_id>`. That keeps the client code identical to production — it
 * carries whatever token it was handed and never knows it is talking to a mock.
 *
 *     Authorization: Bearer mock:happy
 *     Authorization: Bearer mock:campaign-closed
 *
 * A token that is not in that shape refuses `token_invalid`, exactly as the real seam would.
 *
 * TWO EXTRA ROUTES, both under `/__mock/` so they cannot be confused with the contract:
 *     GET  /__mock/journal   every request received, in order, with its response
 *     POST /__mock/reset     empty the journal
 * The journal is what makes a conversation test assertable: "it asked for comp_terms once and
 * never asked for party_size" is a claim about the journal, not about the audio.
